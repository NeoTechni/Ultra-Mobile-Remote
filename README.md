How to connect to a UMRemote server:

The program automatically listens for clients
It SHOULD listen on port 21 by default, which is what Telnet uses. 
To find out what port it is listening on, click Options or your IP address in the top right corner
You can connect with a web browser as well to let devices such as the best handheld gaming system ever (PSP) act as a remote
Some web browsers (Firefox) will not connect to that port so if you want to use them you'll have to change it by clicking Options
Do not send a Query string (ie: a url with text after a question mark) by yourself as it will be interpreted as a telnet command

How to make HTML templates for UMRemote:

This program makes use of [QuickTags].
Supported [tags] will be replaced with text generated by the program
Like XML or HTML files, they can contain properties
ie: [Tag Value="text"]
Certain %subtags% inside of those properties will also be replaced
Quicktags must be enclosed in [ ] brackets to be recognized, with no space between the [ and the tag name
Subtags must be enclosed in % symbols, with no spaces inside
They are not case sensitive (a=A)
You cannot use quotes inside quotes. So use apostrophies for text inside subtags
ie: [Tag Value="<a href='example'>"]
